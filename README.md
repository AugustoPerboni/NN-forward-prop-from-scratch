# Neural Network Forward Propagation with NumPy 🚀

Welcome to my project! This repository contains a **from-scratch** implementation of forward propagation in a neural network, using only **NumPy** and **matrix multiplication**. 🧠📊

## Features ✨

- 🌐 **Fully functional** neural network forward propagation
- ⚡ **Efficient** matrix multiplication
- 🔢 **Supports** multiple layers and activation functions

## How It Works 🧩

Here you can see that Neural Network in just a chain of matrix multiplication.
